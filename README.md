[00:02.16] Don't you give me your love and passion?
[00:04.89] Believe in love, even though
[00:06.67] There're borders and disturbance and more
[00:08.89] I'm the only one who loves you
[00:11.04] Because I'm crazy about you
[00:24.54] 
[00:13.00] Let's ride to hell 追従してGo
[00:15.81] 一緒なら寧ろ死にたいじゃない
[00:18.29] Beyond the line 果てなんかない
[00:20.51] I swear, I'm gonna be so fucking grateful
[00:41.01] 
[00:22.92] Blessing word 貴方は至高
[00:25.00] 命令に Your highness 忠実にFollow
[00:27.33] You give orders 渡しはしない
[00:29.75] 何より尊い存在よ
[00:33.75] 
[00:32.21] You don't know why my love is crying
[00:34.42] 凝着したい 過剰なくらい
[00:36.52] 永遠になりたい don't wanna cry
[00:38.45] 嫉妬妄想狂いそうよ
[00:42.95] 
[00:43.42] Don't you give me your love and passion?
[00:45.66] 愛とは暴動衝動 Let go
[00:48.30] 精神以上に本能 心臓まで more 要求したい
[00:52.59] I don't want to live in a world without you
[00:55.15] 貴方以外のこの未来を kill it, kill it
[00:59.58] I would be happy to kill it for my love
[01:19.08] 
[01:11.09] Go till the end 視線はlock
[01:13.45] 遮られずに遂げたい願い
[01:15.84] Straight to you 純心はfly
[01:18.14] Above the star and sun... so fucking wonderful
[01:20.54] Hey, get out 冗談じゃない
[01:22.74] 視界のdirtyは排除してtrash
[01:25.08] Kick them out 容赦など無い
[01:27.34] 誰より譲れぬ存在よ
[01:31.84] 
[01:29.81] I'm in the dark, can't see your eyes
[01:32.27] 暗い視えない 孤独は痛い
[01:34.52] 共に居たい No more time
[01:36.52] 窒息もう苦しいよ
[01:40.52] 
[01:41.54] Won't you come and hold me tight
[01:43.66] 愛とは純情結晶 Get all
[01:46.07] 想像以上の恩情、hardな応え要望してる
[01:50.59] I wanna make it with you, baby
[01:52.78] 貴方の愛を得られるなら risk it, risk it
[01:57.42] I'm gonna risk it all what's for two of us
[02:18.42] 
[02:18.22] 狂う 愛憎模様 Marble に溶解して
[02:22.88] One and all 融合 焦燥さえも
[02:27.58] 形状は悲壮 自由に細胞単位で
[02:32.20] You don't know why my love is crying
[02:34.60] 凝着したい 過剰なくらい
[02:36.96] 永遠になりたい Don't wanna cry
[02:38.63] 抱擁してよもっと
[02:42.63] 
[02:45.76] Don't you give me your love and passion?
[02:47.92] 貴方の全て頂戴
[02:50.75] 理由なんて要らない 唯愛し愛されてたい
[02:54.95] I don't want to live in a world without you
[02:57.48] 貴方以外何も要らない Get it, get it
[03:01.97] I can't resist it, get it for my love
[03:20.47] 
[03:08.76] I'll spend my life for loving you
[03:11.47] Kill it, kill it
[03:13.36] I'm imagining now, if you're mine
[03:15.52] It's like a paradise and haven and more
[03:17.91] You're the only man who I love
[03:20.15] In my life and destiny and all
[03:35.15] 
[03:24.04] Don't you give me your love and passion?
[03:26.38] I know the border, It should be wrecked, go
